## Assets
All images and fonts used are free where no attribution required

## Backend
The application does not have a separate backend for proper data persistence.

A REST backend is mocked by an InMemoryDbService (InLocalStorageDataService) which uses the browser's local storage (not secure!) for saving player scores (the application can be restarted without losing player scores).
